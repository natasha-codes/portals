# portals

We started work on `portals` to get a simple, elegant, robust, and open-source window switcher for MacOS. After working on it for a while, we found [AltTab](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos), which accomplished all of those goals, and archived our work on Portals in favor of using and contributing to AltTab. We learned a ton and had a blast!
